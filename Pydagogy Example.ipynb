    "Pydagogy is a Python library for providing feedback to students working on coding exercises. I'm building this with online courses in mind. Students in online courses often don't have access to immediate help, either from instructors, mentors, or other students. Typically this results in students getting stuck on coding exercises, leading to frustration and disengagement. Pydagogy provides code checkers that students can use to provide help, solutions, and feedback while they are working on their exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content developers use Pydagogy to create code checkers. These checkers provide hints and solutions, as well as check if a student's results are correct. These checkers sit in a file separate from the main Python file with the exercise code. The checkers are imported into the main file, then used by the student to print out assistance and check their work.\n",
